# rule-based-classification
This project is included in the Data Scientist Bootcamp training created by the Miuul data science school based on the curriculum prepared by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for industry professionals.
# In this study, how to do rule-based classification and customer-based revenue calculation # have been discussed step by step.
#Business Problem
A game company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) by using some features of its customers, creating segments according to these new customer definitions, and estimating how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.
#Dataset story
The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information about the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.
#Variables
-SOURCE – The type of device the customer is connecting to
-PRICE - Customer's spending amount
-SEX – Gender of the client
-COUNTRY – Customer's country
-AGE – The age of the customer
